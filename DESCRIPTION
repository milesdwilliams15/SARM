Description: SARM contains tools for estimating a strategic autoregressive model 
    (SARM), an empirical model based on a formal game theoretic model of the 
    production of either a collective (public) or rival (private) good. The model 
    allows the user to predict strategic allocation of resources as a function 
    of predictors that determine intrinsic preference for the strategic good,
    actor-specific resource contraints, and other-actor resource allocations.
